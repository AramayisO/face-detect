![](demo.gif)

Face Detect is a ReactJS application that allows users to input an image URL and uses the Clarifai API to detect human faces and draw bounding boxes around them.

## Live app
You can access the live application at http://facedetect.ml

## Running the app locally
Clone this repo. Then navigate to the project root directory and run the following commands
```
npm install
npm start
```
You must add your own API key in the src/App.js file to connect to the Clarifai API. 

You can get a Clarifai API key at https://www.clarifai.com/.
